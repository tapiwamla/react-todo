# React Todo

The Todo List App is a simple web application that allows you to manage and organize your tasks in a user-friendly interface. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and filter tasks based on their completion status. The app also utilizes local storage to store your tasks so you can access them even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your todo list.
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted using checkboxes.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- Filter tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, Uncompleted).
- Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage for easy access.
